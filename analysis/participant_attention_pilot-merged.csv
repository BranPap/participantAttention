    <p>After each sentence, you will be asked to fill in a missing word that best completes the sentence. Please read carefully and do your best to understand the meaning of each sentence.</p>

    <p>In this experiment, you will read a series of 48 sentences that appear one word at a time in the center of the screen. Each trial will begin with a black '+' in the middle. Focus on this '+' and continue watching as the words replace it. The words are presented quickly, and you will not be able to review the sentence after it has passed.</p>
    <p>After each sentence, you will be asked to fill in a missing word that best completes the sentence. Please read carefully and do your best to understand the meaning of each sentence.</p>
    <p>The experiment will take about 10-15 minutes to complete.</p>
